üìâKanban:"A kanban table of the project state with todo, doing, done columns."

# Cross-Identification Process
When working on code that interacts with elements from different files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), make sure to cross-identify all relevant class & ID names. Note these names & ensure they are correctly targeted in the JavaScript code & aligns with the existing structure.
